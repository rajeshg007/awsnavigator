# AWSNavigator

Project is created keeping in mind the aws infra mangers, who find it easier to use a CLI based tool to get things done, Rather than use a UI, which is oftentimes slower.

It helps manage a few items better than AWS Console or AWS CLI, by providing simple and intuitive commands.

This tool utilizes aws cli and boto3 to create the needed functionality.
